# Ourthritis

## Mission statement

Ourthritis aims to be an information portal for individuals living with arthritis. Its initial focus will be on psoriatic arthritis as there is limited knowledge on the subject when compared to the likes of rheumatoid arthritis, for example. Indiviiduals diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis can find it difficult to find specific information on the condition as it tends to be lumped in with the other types.

Initially the focus will be on information and services pertaining to Norther Ireland, but future development to include U.K., E.U. and, the rest of the world.


### Features

-News aggregator that updates daily to show the most recent articles from reputable news and research organisations. These will be archived for future reference.


-Proprietary articles written using scientific research but presented in such a way that anyone can benefit from reading them. These will take the user, through a journey of discovery in topics like; arthritis symptoms, causes, and risks; living with inflammation and autoimmune conditions, as well as information on diet, exercise and mental health.


-As a sufferer of psoriatic arthritis myself, I would have been thankful for a portal such as this in the first few months and years of diagnosis. As I was studying Biomedical Science at the time, I was able to find alot of this information myself. I have decided to try and create this portal with the end goal being that people, like myself, can use it to give themselves the best start when diagnosed with a condition such as this.
